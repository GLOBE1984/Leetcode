Divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

If it is overflow, return MAX_INT.




Overview
Before we get started on the actual approaches, let's cover a few other important things.

Doing this question "properly", following all the rules given, makes this one of our most difficult medium-level questions.

Don't panic, you don't need to know all the approaches

We have provided a lot of different approaches to show how many different ways there are of solving this question. Approach 1 is a brute-force, and then Approaches 2 to 4 build on each other, and Approach 5 is similar, but approaches the thinking from a very different angle. If you only want to study the first 2 approaches, then that's fine. Approach 2 should be sufficient for an interview. However, we hope you enjoy learning about this question enough that you'll keep reading! :-)

Make sure you read the question carefully

This question was designed with fixed-sized integers in mind. Some languages, such as Python and JavaScript, only have arbitrary-precision integers (meaning they can go huge, probably as big as you'll ever need!). Depending on which programming languages you're familiar with, the requirements of this question might seem a little tedious and silly to you. We recommend using a language such as C, C++, or Java for it if you're familiar with them. Otherwise, you'll just need to be really careful and think very carefully about whether or not your algorithm would work in a 32-bit-signed-integer environment. Unfortunately, Leetcode doesn't currently enforce these requirements in languages such as Python, so it's up to you to determine whether or not your solution really is a "correct" one. Hint: Throw heaps of assert statements into your code.

Most of the upvoted posts on the discussion forum aren't following the rules specified in the question. Here are some of the problems I've seen:

The use of long in Java or long long in C++ is not allowed, because the question states that we're working in an environment where we only have integers within the range [?2^{31}, 2^{31} ? 1].
The use of abs in Python (and other arbitrary-precision integer languages) needs to be considered carefully, because abs(-2^{31}) = 2^{31}, which is outside the allowed range by 1.
While you might be tempted to use multiplication and division for a few "simple" tasks, this is unnecessary. Here are some alternatives:
Instead of a = a * -1 for making numbers negative, use a = -a.
Instead of using a / 2 for dividing by 2, use the right shift operator; a >> 1.
Instead of using a * 2 for doubling, use a = a + a, a += a, or even the left shift operator; a << 1.
Additionally, we strongly advise against allowing overflows to happen at all. For some compilers/interpreters/languages, INT_MAX + 1 กิ INT_MIN. For others, INT_MAX + 1 กิ INT_MAX. And for others again, it is undefined or crash. Some people on the discussion forum have written code that actually relies on specific overflow behaviour for correctness. While this can be quite "clever", it's not portable at all. For code like that to be shippable, you'd need to be certain of the behaviour of the specific system it is to run on, and that no future system upgrade would change the behaviour. If it works on your machine, but not on Leetcode's machine, it's incorrect code.

In this article, we'll be looking at a few techniques that can solve the problem elegantly and are portable.

In what cases will the final result be out of range?

We're told the following about overflow in the problem description:

For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 31 ? 131?1 when the division result overflows.

So, keeping in mind that our integer range is [?2^{31}, 2^{31} ? 1], in what cases could we have an end result outside of this range?

Well, when we do a / b = c, where a and b are both positive integers, we know that c ก a. In other words, the answer (c) cannot end up bigger than the thing we divided (the dividend, a).

Something similar happens even when one or both of them are negative. In that case, abs(a) ก abs(c). Another way of thinking about it is that c will always be closer to zero than a is (or, they could also be equal).

Therefore, for a and b within the range [?2^{31} + 1, 2^{31} ? 1], the result a / b will be closer to zero, so has to be fine.

However, notice we left -2^{31} out of the above range. This is because there's a special case of -2^{31} / -1, which has an answer of 2^{31}. But 2^{31} is outside of the integer range! So instead we return 2^{31}-1 for this case (which is in range).

Most algorithms for this question simply check for the case -2^{31} / -1 at the start, returning 2^{31} - 1 if they detect it. This is a sensible approach.
