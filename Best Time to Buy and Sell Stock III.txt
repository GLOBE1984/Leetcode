Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).




public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices == null || prices.length < 2) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        
        int[] max = new int[prices.length];
        
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.length; ++i) {
            max[i] = 0;
            for(int j = i; j < prices.length; ++j) {
                
            }
        }
    }
}
