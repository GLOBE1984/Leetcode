There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?




public class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        if(ratings == null || ratings.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int[] candies = new int[ratings.length];
        for(int i = 0; i < candies.length; ++i) {
            candies[i] = 1;
        }
        
        int current = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < candies.length; ++i) {
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]) {
                current++;

        current = 1;
        int result = candies[candies.length-1];
        for(int i = (candies.length-2); i >= 0; --i) {
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]) {
